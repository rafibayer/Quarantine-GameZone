## Project description
Quarantine Game-Zone is an application that allows you to play games with others online via a web browser. Players will be able to select a game from a game lobby and add their friend(s) to play!

Our target audience is anyone looking for a way to stay social by playing games, especially during quarantine. There are many other similar services, such as Jackbox, Drawful, and more, but we want to offer a free and easy-to-use alternative. As developers, we want to create an app that we could see ourselves using. As students experiencing this unprecedented online quarter, we think itâ€™s more important than ever to stay connected, and games are a fantastic way to do that.
